# Open Set Learning for RF-based Drone Recognition

This repository is an official implementation of the paper [Open Set Learning for RF-Based Drone Recognition via Signal Semantics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684814) 

The dataset is available at:

- IEEE Dataport: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/wv7h-sv64
- Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pdmxJmbM6aiMZlq6Hlr30PCeEewVL9oC/view?usp=drive_link

Copy the **Data** folder in the dataset to the project directory. 

If you prefer to use an image dataset instead of the provided .npy features, the code now supports loading image files or image directories. Place your images (one image per sample) or image folders and point the experiment group entries to the image path (the loader will try path + image extensions or the first image inside a directory). Images are converted to grayscale and resized to the model input size automatically.

The division of the dataset is provided in the **experiment_groups** folder. The correspondence between its index and the senario in the manuscript is shown in the following table.

| index in experiment_groups | the senario in the manuscript |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
